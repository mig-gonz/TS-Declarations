# Type Declarations for Lodash Functions

In this project, I have created type declaration functions for the Lodash library. These type declarations are defined in the index.d.ts file and provide TypeScript support and type checking when using Lodash functions throughout the codebase.

The purpose of creating these type declarations is to enhance code maintainability and improve the developer experience by ensuring that the correct types are enforced when working with Lodash functions. This helps catch potential errors early on and provides better autocompletion and type inference in your IDE.
